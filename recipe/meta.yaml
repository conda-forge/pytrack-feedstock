  summary: a Map-Matching-based Python Toolbox for Vehicle Trajectory Reconstruction
  description: |
      PyTrack is a Python package that integrate the recorded GPS coordinates with data provided by the open-source OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
      PyTrack can serve the intelligent transport research, e.g. to develop virtual simulation environments for the first training phase 
      in self-driving vehicle applications, to reconstruct the video of a vehicleâ€™s route by exploiting available data and without equipping 
      it with camera sensors, to update the urban road network, and so on.
